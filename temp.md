Okay, I've reviewed the JavaScript code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){return a+b}
```

Here's my feedback:

**Issues and Suggestions:**

1.  **Missing Variable Declarations:** The variables `a` and `b` are used within the `sum` function but are not declared within the function's scope or passed as arguments. This means the function will likely rely on global variables (if they exist) or result in an error if `a` and `b` are not defined in the surrounding scope.

2.  **Lack of Function Parameters:** The `sum` function is intended to calculate the sum of two numbers, but it doesn't accept any input parameters.  This limits its reusability and makes it less clear how it should be used.

3. **No Documentation:** It's not very clear what the purpose of the function is without a descriptive name or some comments.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Declare Variables or Use Parameters:** The best approach is to pass the numbers to be summed as arguments to the function. If you intend to use global variables (which is generally discouraged), make sure they are properly initialized before calling the function.

*   **Add Function Parameters:** Define parameters to receive the numbers to be summed.

*   **Add Documentation:** Add a comment at the top of the function so it's clear what the function does.

**Improved Code:**

Here's an improved version of the code:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let result = sum(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Parameters:** The `sum` function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the numbers to be added.

*   **Local Scope:** The function now operates on the input parameters, avoiding reliance on global variables and making it more predictable.

*   **Return Value:**  The function now returns the calculated sum.

*   **Documentation:** There's a block comment above the function that describes what the function does, what arguments it takes and what it returns.

This revised version is more robust, reusable, and follows better coding practices.  It's also much clearer in its intent.
